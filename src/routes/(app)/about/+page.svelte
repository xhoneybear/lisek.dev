        My name is Camille.
        I'm a young programmer based in Wrocław, Poland.
        I'm currently studying medical informatics
        at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a geek at heart and a huge medical freak.
        I work to do both informatics and medicine at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a cosmopolitan by heart and I love learning languages.
        To date, I know Polish, English, Chinese and Spanish pretty well,
        while also learning other languages like French, Czech, Dutch and Vietnamese.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also love to express myself artistically. I try to draw and sing
        in my free time and I have a dream of learning to play a guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
        I play a lot of games and try to develop my own one.
        I'm mostly keen on indie games. Currently, I'm very fixated
        on Undertale and Deltarune. I also love games like Anuchard,
        Hollow Knight, Minecraft, Fez and Antichamber.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a queer and neurodivergent person!
